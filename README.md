# Data_Science_Project
This repository contains the Data Science project in the "Artificial Intelligence & Data Science" University course.

The aim of this project is to compare the performances of 3 different Machine learning models for a forecast regression.
The dataset is based on the number of passengers in approximately 20 years of US flights.
Models that have been used are:
- Random Forest;
- Linear Regression;
- KNN K-Nearest Neighbors.

The code can be found in the main.py file.

# TODO Some dependencies must be installed in base of the used IDE.
